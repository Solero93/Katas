# CodingDojo Katas

This is a repo to upload my own Kata and see my progress.

Each kata is to be done repeatedly, so inside all katas the folders are named the date they were finished.

My objective with this repo is to practice TDD and other software design principles in order to become a better professional.

.idea folders are to be found inside each kata so that the workspace I am using is maintained.
